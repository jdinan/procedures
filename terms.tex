\section{Document Definitions}

\end{itemize}

OpenSHMEM specification documents are marked with monotonically increasing
version numbers using a major/minor version number scheme.

\section{Definitions of Roles}

The following defines the roles of the people or groups of people
involved in the OpenSHMEM specification process:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf OpenSHMEM Committee:} The group of
  contributors
  actively involved in the
  specification process by participation in official meetings,
  participation in OpenSHMEM working groups, and section committees.
\item {\bf OpenSHMEM Committee Chair:} Is responsible for organizing the agenda
  for official OpenSHMEM Committee meetings as well as the activities leading to the
  publication of the OpenSHMEM Specification. The Committee
  Chair also maintains the overall outside presence of the OpenSHMEM Committee.
  The OpenSHMEM committee chair role is filled through a regular
  ballot.  Upon a successful vote on this ballot, the change goes into effect
  immediately.
\item {\bf OpenSHMEM Committee Secretary:} Is responsible for organizing and
  recording ballots as well as artifacts from the official OpenSHMEM Committee
  meetings.
  The OpenSHMEM committee secretary role is filled through a regular
  ballot.  Upon a successful vote on this ballot, the change goes into effect
  immediately.
\item {\bf OpenSHMEM Specification Document Editor:} Is responsible for both
  maintaining the overall document and its repository, and for
  publishing newly ratified versions of the OpenSHMEM documents.
\item {\bf Section Committee Chair (sometimes referred to as ``Section

\item {\bf Working Group:} Group of people working on individual,
  possibly cross-cutting topics that can lead to proposed changes for

  Working groups are established and dissolved through an official
  ballot at an OpenSHMEM meeting.  In order to enable rapid exploration of new
  topics, ballots to establish new working groups can be added to the agenda at

  members are encouraged to schedule such ballots at least two weeks prior to
  the start date of the official OpenSHMEM meeting.

  Group, and organizing regular Working Group meetings.

\section{Ballot Definitions}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Official OpenSHMEM Committee Meeting:} An open meeting of the entire
  OpenSHMEM Committee.  Attendance to the meeting is open to
  all organizations in the OpenSHMEM Committee as well as the general public.
  Official OpenSHMEM meetings can be scheduled at any time by the OpenSHMEM
  committee chair or secretary.

\item {\bf Organization:} A business entity that sends one or more
  representatives to a official OpenSHMEM Committee meeting.

\item {\bf Overall Organization Eligibility (OOE):} An organization is
  generally eligible to vote if it
  has signed the OpenSHMEM contributor agreement and had one or more

  official OpenSHMEM committee meetings (including the current meeting).
  Alternatively, an organization is generally eligible to vote if it has not
  signed the OpenSHMEM contributor agreement and had one or more
  representatives present at four of the last five official OpenSHMEM committee
  meetings (including the current meeting).

\item {\bf Meeting Quorum:} Quorum is established at a official OpenSHMEM
  Committee meeting when more than $\nicefrac{2}{3}$ of OOE organizations

  individual ballot when more than $\nicefrac{3}{4}$ of OOE
  organizations at the meeting cast a vote (vs.\ abstain).  The number
  of OOE organizations is counted at the beginning of each ballot.
